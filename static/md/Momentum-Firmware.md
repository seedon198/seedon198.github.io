# ﻿Momentum Firmware

**Momentum Firmware** refers to the underlying software embedded in devices made by **Momentum**, a company specializing in smart home and security products like cameras, doorbells, and home automation systems. Firmware in this context acts as the operating system for their hardware, enabling the device to perform its functions.

1. It’s well and good if you have the latest Momentum Firmware. If not, then we can install it like these.
1. There are two ways to upgrade your firmware.
   1. Direct by websit. <https://momentum-fw.dev/>
   1. Using QFlipper (Desktop App) Get the update from the gihub and implement the firmware via qFlipper application. <https://flipperzero.one/downloads>
   1. Via Mobile Apps
   1. DFU (Device Firmware Update) Mode via Command Line.
   1. Manual Update via SD Card (offline way)
1. Here, we shall be covering all the ways.
1. Going through the d
1. Connect the flipper zero and your PC with a data cable. Go to the <https://momentum-fw.dev/> in PC. We’re going to use the web version for updating/installing the firmware.Also, it’s good, if nothing else is connected to the flipper except momentum.

Directly by the website. <https://momentum-fw.dev/>

1. Go to **Install -> Connect -> Select the name of your flipper**

2. Now the firmware will get installed in your Flipper Zero. Installation has been done.

Using QFlipper (Desktop App):

Here, we shall be updating the firmware via the file of firmware via github and will be maintaining the backup of the file, in case we want to revert it back and if something went wrong. We shall be using the qFlipper here.

What is qFlipper?

It is an application, providing you the GUI, CLI or interactive way of managing your Flipper zero. Basically it is a desktop application that allows you to update the firmware and databases of a Flipper Zero device:

**Features**: Update firmware and supplemental data, repair broken firmware, stream and control the Flipper Zero display remotely, install firmware from a .dfu file, and back up and restore settings, progress, and pairing data

**Availability**: Available on Windows, macOS, and Linux

**Open source**: Based on the Qt framework.

*More on this: [https://docs.flipper.net/qflipper*](https://docs.flipper.net/qflipper)*

*To get the application: [https://flipperzero.one/downloads*](https://flipperzero.one/downloads)*

1. Install the qFlipper. Install and connect the Flipper Zero via data cable to your PC. The application will identify it and dump the details about it.

Like, right now, I have the momentum firmware of version *MNTM-007* and the latest version is of *MNTM-008* (while writing this blog).

2. Let’s backup first. Backup the data of our current state of flipper zero.
   1. Go through the “**Advanced controls”** option, next to Device information (i) button. There you get the option for Backup, Restore and other features and updates, including for the application itself.
   1. Save this .tgz backup file somewhere, you might require in future.
2. You can directly download the latest version using “**Install”** feature button. This will directly install the latest released firmware to your flipper zero.
2. Or if you want your other version or wanna do it through downloading the .tgz file first to your PC,
1. First download the version you want from: <https://github.com/Next-Flip> and download the version. Here I’m downloading the latest version MNTM-008.
1. Go to the **“Install from file”** option. Select the .tgz file you have downloaded.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seedon198/seedon198.github.io/refs/heads/master/static/media/blogs/Momentum%20Firmware/screenshot5.jpeg)

3. Wait for sometimes, it will install the firmware to your flipper zero.

Via Mobile App

1. Download the Mobile app of FlipperZero via Playstore/Appstore. <https://docs.flipper.net/mobile-app>
1. Turn On the bluetooth of both Mobile and Flipper Zero. For FlipperZero go to the **Settings -> Bluetooth -> On.**
3. Let the Device search for the FlipperZero. Once found, connect with the FlipperZero, “

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seedon198/seedon198.github.io/refs/heads/master/static/media/blogs/Momentum%20Firmware/screenshot7.jpeg)

**Pair and Connect”** option will come. Keep going and allow the required permissions. The code will appear on the Flipper in order to connect to the app.
3. If unable to connect, you can try again, or in the same section of FlipperZero of bluetooth, look for **“Unpair All Devices”.** Then try to reconnect via bluetooth. Otherwise, there’s also an option to connect via the cable via Mobile and Flipper.
3. After pairing, the control can be seen on the app itself. It will have the main home page. Showing the details of current firmware, version, updates available and hence the option to download and install. Same like this other pages are also available.

6. In the home page, as we can see, there’s an option of updating the firmware as well along with the device info. On the dropdown of “**Update Channel”** we may find out the desired update options including the Released, Candidate, Development and Custom firmware version. Select the required one.
6. Go for the **“Install”**. The installation will begin on the flipper zero.

Using CLI options:

1. Using qFlipper.
1. Download and install QFlipper from the official website.
1. **Access *qFlipper-cli***:

a. QFlipper includes a CLI tool that can be used for firmware updates. It is

typically installed alongside the GUI version.

**Steps:**

Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where qFlipper-cli is installed. For example:

cd "C:\Program Files\Flipper Zero QFlipper"

Use the command to update the firmware:

qflipper-cli update-firmware <path\_to\_firmware\_file>

1. Replace <path\_to\_firmware\_file> with the path to your firmware file.
1. Let the process finish. The device should reboot once updated.

DFU (Device Firmware Update) Mode via Command Line Env Variable issue.

Manual Update via SD Card (offline way)

Flipper not able to detect the .dfu and update.fuf file, hence not getting the option to update the firmware, neither from flipper zero not from the PC.

**Common Issues and Fixes**

1. Flipper Zero Not Recognized by PC
- **Cause**: USB connection or driver issues.
- **Solution**:
- Ensure you're using a reliable USB-C cable (some are charge-only and not data-capable).
