# Advanced Lockpicking

## Introduction to Advanced Techniques
In this section, we will explore advanced lockpicking techniques that go beyond basic pin tumbler locks, including **RFID locks**, **car locks**, **safes**, **hand cuffs**, **disc detainer locks** and more, which are essential for any serious lockpicking enthusiast. If you are new to lockpicking, we recommend taking a look at the basics [here](https://keagtorb.github.io/seasides2025/lockpicking-101). We will also discuss **copying keys** using **Flipper Zero** and **Key Decoder**. Additionally, we will cover tools beyond the basic hook pick and tension wrench, including **Lishi tools** and more.

## Types of Locks Beyond Pin Tumblers

### Disc Detainer Locks
- **Description**: Disc detainer locks consist of a series of discs that must be rotated to a specific angle to unlock. They are often used in high-security applications.

To use a disc detainer pick, begin by inserting the pick fully into the lock, aligning it with the discs until it reaches the back. Apply gentle rotational tension with the pick’s tensioner to hold the discs in place as you work. Starting from the back, carefully rotate each disc one at a time, setting each to its correct angle. You'll feel a subtle "give" or feedback when each disc is positioned correctly. Gradually move toward the front of the lock, aligning each disc until they are all set. With all discs in place, increase the tension slightly; the core should then rotate, unlocking the lock.

### Wafer Locks

- **Description**: Wafer locks are commonly used in items like file cabinets, desk locks, and automotive locks. They contain a series of flat wafers that need to be aligned at the shear line to unlock. Wafer locks are generally less secure than pin tumbler or disc detainer locks but are widely used for their simplicity.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KEAGTORB/seasides2025/refs/heads/main/images/lockpicking/wafer-lock.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Wafer Lock">

- **Techniques**: There are two main tools used to pick wafer locks: a wafer pick and a Lishi tool.

    - **Using a Wafer Pick**: Insert the wafer pick into the lock and apply gentle rotational pressure with a tension tool. One by one, lift each wafer until it reaches the shear line. Once all wafers are aligned, the lock should rotate and open.

### Car Locks

- **Description**: Many car locks, especially in older models, use wafer locks similar to those found in furniture locks. However, automotive wafer locks tend to be more complex and may include additional security features. These locks are commonly found on car doors, ignition switches, and trunks.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KEAGTORB/seasides2025/refs/heads/main/images/lockpicking/car-lock.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Car Lock">

- **Techniques**: There are four main methods to unlock a car wafer lock: using a wafer pick, a specialized automotive Lishi tool, a pump wedge, or a Flipper Zero device.

    - **Using a Wafer Pick**: Insert the wafer pick into the car lock keyway and apply light rotational pressure with a tension tool. Carefully lift each wafer individually to align it with the shear line. Once all wafers are set correctly, the lock will turn and open.

    - **Using an Automotive Lishi Tool**: Automotive Lishi tools are specifically designed for car locks, providing precise control over each wafer. Insert the Lishi tool into the keyway and align each wafer to the shear line individually, allowing the lock to turn and open.

    - **Using a Pump Wedge**: The pump wedge is a non-invasive technique useful for unlocking car doors without picking the lock. Insert the wedge between the door and the frame, then inflate it slowly to create a small gap. Once there’s enough space, use a long-reach tool to manipulate the door’s unlock mechanism or pull the handle from the inside.

### Safe Lock Picking

- **Description**: Safes are designed to provide high security for valuables and often use vulnerable locking mechanisms. This guide focuses on using the Adjustable Tubular Smith Pick tool to pick the backup lock area.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KEAGTORB/seasides2025/refs/heads/main/images/lockpicking/safe-lock.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Safe Lock">

- **Technique**: 

    - **Using the Adjustable Tubular Smith Pick Tool**: The Adjustable Tubular Smith Pick is specifically designed for tubular locks found in many safes. The tool features a series of prongs that can be adjusted to fit the specific configuration of the lock. To use it, insert the pick into the lock and adjust the prongs to make contact with the pins. By applying tension and manipulating the pick, you can align the pins to the shear line, allowing the lock to open. Mastering this tool requires practice and a good understanding of the lock’s mechanism.

### Handcuff Picking

- **Description**: Handcuffs are a type of restraint used primarily by law enforcement to secure an individual's wrists. They typically feature a locking mechanism that can be difficult to open without the key. Picking handcuffs requires specialized tools and techniques, but it can be done with some practice.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KEAGTORB/seasides2025/refs/heads/main/images/lockpicking/handcuffs.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Handcuffs">

### Techniques

- **Using a Paper Clip**:  
    Unfold the paper clip to create a straight section with a small hook at the end. Insert the hooked end into the keyhole, apply slight tension, and twist to catch the locking pin. Move it up and down until the lock releases.

- **Using a Bobby Pin**:  
   A bobby pin can also work as an improvised handcuff pick. Straighten the bobby pin, bending one end into a small hook. Insert it into the keyhole, apply gentle pressure, and twist to push the locking pin. Wiggle it slightly to release the ratchet.

- **Using a Shim**:  
   A shim is a thin metal strip that can bypass the locking mechanism by sliding between the handcuff’s ratchet and pawl. Insert the shim into the side of the cuff to press down the locking bar, allowing the cuff to open without needing a key.

# Cloning RFID Door with Flipper Zero

An RFID door is a type of access control system that uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to unlock or secure entry points, like doors. Instead of traditional keys, these doors use RFID-enabled devices such as key fobs or access cards to transmit data and gain entry.

You can clone the RFID signal with Flipper Zero, a multi-tool that can emulate or copy RFID signals. Once you clone the RFID key, you can use the Flipper Zero as the new key.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KEAGTORB/seasides2025/refs/heads/main/images/lockpicking/rfid-door.png" width="400" height="300" alt="RFID Door">

## How to Clone an RFID Signal with Flipper Zero

To clone an RFID signal with Flipper Zero, follow these steps:

1. **Scan the RFID Signal**: 
   Use the Flipper Zero's built-in RFID reader to scan the signal of the key fob or card. Make sure the device is within range and press the "Read" button on Flipper Zero to capture the signal.

2. **Save the RFID Signal**: 
   Once the signal is captured, it will be saved to Flipper Zero's memory. You can view the saved RFID signals in the device's interface.

3. **Write to a Blank RFID Tag**: 
   If you have a blank RFID tag or key fob, select the saved RFID signal from the memory of Flipper Zero and write it to the new device. This will clone the signal and allow you to use the new tag as the original key.

4. **Test the New RFID Tag**: 
   Once the cloning process is complete, test the new tag by holding it near the RFID reader. If successful, it should grant access just like the original.

## Limitations of Cloning RFID Signals

While Flipper Zero is a powerful tool for cloning RFID signals, it does have some limitations:

- **Range of the Reader**: Flipper Zero can only read RFID signals within its operational range, which may vary depending on the RFID technology and power of the reader.
  
- **Signal Encryption**: Some RFID systems use encryption or other security measures to prevent cloning. In such cases, Flipper Zero may not be able to clone the signal without additional steps or modifications.

- **Legal Considerations**: Cloning RFID signals without permission is illegal in many jurisdictions and can lead to criminal charges. Always ensure that you have proper authorization before attempting to clone any RFID signals.

## Security Risks

Cloning RFID signals poses several security risks to systems that rely on this technology:

1. **Unauthorized Access**: If an attacker successfully clones an RFID signal, they could gain unauthorized access to restricted areas. This could be particularly dangerous in high-security environments like offices, data centers, or even residential properties.
   
2. **System Vulnerabilities**: Many RFID systems use weak or unencrypted signals, making them vulnerable to cloning. It is important for organizations to use more secure RFID systems that implement encryption and advanced security features to prevent unauthorized access.

3. **Reputation Damage**: If RFID cloning occurs in a corporate or governmental context, it could lead to reputational damage, financial loss, or legal consequences.

## Alternatives to Cloning RFID Signals

If you're looking for more advanced or secure methods of bypassing RFID systems, here are some alternatives:

- **RFID Spoofing**: This involves tricking an RFID reader into thinking it’s receiving a legitimate signal by broadcasting a fake signal. While similar to cloning, it can be more complex and harder to detect.
  
- **Keycard Hacking**: Some keycards use proprietary encryption methods. In such cases, specialized equipment or software is required to break the encryption and clone the keycard.

- **Social Engineering**: In some cases, the best way to bypass an RFID system may be through social engineering tactics, such as convincing someone to provide you with access or key information.

### 2. Copying Physical Keys with KeyDecoder

 [KeyDecoder](https://github.com/MaximeBeasse/KeyDecoder) is a mobile app created for pentesters and security enthusiasts. It allows users to easily measure a key's bitting from a picture of the key.



### Step 1: Take a Picture
- **Prepare the Key**: Remove the key from its key ring and place it in the center of an ISO/CEI 7810 ID-1 sized card (such as a credit card or business card). This card must measure exactly 85.60 by 53.98 mm (3 3⁄8 in × 2 1⁄8 in).
- **Capture the Image**: Ensure the picture is high-resolution and well-lit to improve accuracy.

### Step 2: Crop the Image
- **Use Green Lines**: Crop the image using the green guidelines to retain only the card area. Use zoom for precise adjustments.

### Step 3: Align Key Reference Lines
- **Back Line (Red)**: Align the red line to match the back edge of the key.
- **Shoulder Line (Blue)**: Align the blue line with the key's shoulder for accurate measurements.

### Step 4: Measure the Key Bitting
- **Mark Cuts**: Place points in the center of each key cut. Once all cuts are marked, validate to retrieve the measurements.
- **Retrieve Measurements**: Your measurements will now be available on your project’s page in the app.

### Step 5: Cut the New Key
- **Transfer Measurements**: Using the bitting measurements from KeyDecoder, transfer the specifications to a blank key.
- **Cut the Key**: Use a key-cutting machine to create a duplicate, following the measurements precisely.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Importance of Compliance
- Understanding the legal implications of lockpicking is crucial. Always ensure that you have permission to pick a lock and that your activities comply with local laws.

- **Intent and Use**: It is essential to have a clear intent for your lockpicking activities. Lockpicking should only be practiced for legitimate purposes, such as education, locksmithing, or lawful access to your own property.

- **Consequences of Misuse**: Misuse of lockpicking skills can lead to serious legal consequences, including criminal charges. Engaging in lockpicking without permission, especially in sensitive environments, can be viewed as an attempt at burglary or trespassing.
