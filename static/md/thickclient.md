## What the Heck is a Thick Client?

Alright, “Thick Client” (or, if you prefer, “Fat Client”) is just a fancy term for a chubby app that does most of the work right there on your computer. It’s the kind of app that takes matters into its own hands with minimal reliance on remote servers.

### Examples:

Your favorite old-school desktop app that still wants you to download it locally (and may or may not try to chat up a web server now and then).

## Thick Client Architectures (Yes, They’re as Clunky as They Sound)

### Two-Tier Architecture

Imagine a client-side app that's a bit clingy and wants a direct line to the database on the server. No middlemen here; it’s just you, your app, and a server hanging out and exchanging secrets.

### Three-Tier Architecture

Now we’ve got an app with some self-control. Instead of spilling its heart out to the server, it whispers to an application server, which then decides what to say to the database. This little setup helps keep nosy users away from the database.

## Types of Thick Clients (Because, of course, we need more categories)

### Proxy-Aware Thick Clients

These clients are on their best behavior and let you configure a proxy server. Testing is smooth sailing here since intercepting requests is a breeze.

- **Tools to Use**: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP.

### Proxy-Unaware Thick Clients

Cue the groans. These clients are blissfully unaware of proxies, which makes testing about as pleasant as untangling Christmas lights.

- **Tools to Use**: Echo Mirage, MITM Proxy. Get comfy—you’ll be here for a while.

## Methodology for Thick Client Pentesting: How to Make an App Spill Its Secrets

Let’s dive in and see what your thick client is hiding. Here’s the play-by-play for making it confess every single vulnerability, whether it likes it or not.

### Step 1: Data Gathering – Finding Out What’s the Deal?

Before you go crashing into things, let’s get the basics. What is this app supposed to do? Is it sensitive? Are we dealing with financial data here, or is it just a weather app that thinks it's too cool for the cloud?

- **Understand Application Context**: Why does this app exist? Does it need to store data locally? Do people actually use it?
- **Local Data Assessment**: Get cozy with its local files and databases. Look for anything sensitive it’s storing for no good reason—passwords, logs, session tokens. If it’s in plaintext, even better.

### Step 2: Environment Setup – Setting Up Your Laboratory (Cue the Mad Scientist Laugh)

Before you start poking around, set up a safe environment. Think padded room for the app—where it can thrash around without causing too much damage.

- **Controlled Test Environment**: Spin up a VM, sandbox, or something where you can blow stuff up without setting off alarms.
- **Essential Tools**:
  - **Wireshark**: For seeing if this app is spilling secrets all over the network.
  - **Procmon**: For tracking what files and registry entries it’s touching.
  - **IDA Pro or Ghidra**: Reverse-engineering, because you’re probably going to have to look at some code.
  - **Burp Suite**: For intercepting traffic and setting up the app to reveal its network shenanigans.

### Step 3: Local Storage Analysis – Rummaging Through Its Drawers

Let’s go through all the files, cache, and registry entries to see if this app is keeping anything juicy lying around.

- **Configuration Files**
  - Plaintext Passwords: Yes, we’re hoping. If you find a plaintext password here, it’s an automatic win.
  - **API Keys & Tokens**: Check if the app is leaving these lying around like lost socks. Free access to services? Don’t mind if you do.
- **Registry Keys**
  - Sensitive Data in Registry: Sometimes, devs think nobody will look here, which is exactly why you should.
  - **Registry Permissions**: If the app is feeling generous with permissions, anyone could potentially access sensitive data in these keys.
- **Local Database Vulnerabilities**
  - Unencrypted Local Databases: Does it store passwords, session tokens, or other sensitive data here without encryption? Jackpot.
  - **Weak Encryption**: Sometimes encryption is just for show. See if the app’s using ROT13 or some other “creative” approach to security.
- **Temporary Folders and Cache**
  - Cached Credentials and Tokens: Because who doesn’t love finding plain-text passwords stashed in a temp file?
  - **Personal Data**: Anything sensitive sitting around in random folders is worth looking at, and probably a security nightmare waiting to happen.

### Step 4: Network Traffic Analysis – Snooping on Its Secret Chats

Time to intercept traffic and see what kind of secrets this app is blabbing to the server. Get ready for some potential TMI moments.

- **Packet Sniffing and Interception**
  - **Wireshark**: Use it to catch every little data packet in transit, and cross your fingers for unencrypted credentials.
  - **Plaintext Protocols**: If the app is using HTTP, FTP, or some other open line, it’s basically gift-wrapping data for you.
- **Session Management and Cookie Security**
  - Insecure Cookies or Tokens: The app might be sending cookies or tokens over insecure channels. Session hijacking, anyone?
  - **Session Expiration Policies**: If you’re lucky, the app will let sessions last forever. Just… why?
- **Request Manipulation**
  - Replay Attacks: Resend previous requests to see if the server just goes, “Oh, hey! Come on in!”
  - **Parameter Tampering**: Mess around with parameters in requests. Change IDs, modify roles. See if the app is gullible enough to let you in where you shouldn’t be.
- **Protocol Misconfigurations**
  - Weak SSL/TLS Versions: You’ll be shocked how many apps still use ancient SSL/TLS. A security relic, and not in a good way.
  - **Certificate Pinning**: If the app doesn’t validate certificates, congrats, you just found an open invitation for a man-in-the-middle attack.

### Step 5: Binary Analysis – Digging Through Its Code (Bring a Shovel)

When all else fails, start dissecting the app itself. Peek into its binary and see if you can find any delightful little secrets.

- **Reverse Engineering**
  - **Hidden Debugging Features**: Devs sometimes leave debug functions in there by mistake. If you find a hidden backdoor, it’s like Christmas.
  - **Hardcoded Secrets**: Hardcoded credentials, API keys, or other secrets? It’s like finding candy in a couch cushion.
- **Code Injection Vulnerabilities**
  - **Command Injection**: Maybe it accepts system commands. Try injecting your own and see what happens.
  - **SQL Injection (Client-Side)**: If the app sends SQL queries directly, you might be able to inject SQL commands and get unauthorized data.
- **Memory Exploits**
  - Buffer Overflow Attacks: These older apps are like creaky doors just waiting for someone to shove them open. Buffer overflows could be your way in.
  - **Heap/Stack Overflow**: If you’re feeling ambitious, go for privilege escalation by messing with memory. It might just work.

### Step 6: Exploitation and Report Creation – Time to Show Off What You’ve Found

If the app hasn’t given up all its secrets yet, now’s the time to go big or go home.

- **Exploitation**
  - **Privilege Escalation**: Now that you’ve mapped out its weaknesses, see if you can crank up your access level. Go on, don the crown.
  - **Authentication Bypass**: See if you can waltz past the login screen. Half the time, these thick clients don’t put up much of a fight.
  - **Logic Flaws and Manipulations**: Sometimes the app’s own logic is its biggest weakness. If it’s doing something silly, exploit it!
- **Reporting**
  - Document Everything: Take screenshots, write steps for replication, and give each vulnerability a nice dramatic name if you feel like it.
  - **Recommendations**: Provide a solution to each problem, or just tell the devs to “please try harder next time.”
